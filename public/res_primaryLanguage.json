I've built the application from scratch on top of WinForms: the parsing engine, sockets communication handler, syntax highlighting, config library, it's an IDE for the company's own programming language. The source files are stored on the server and the IDE communicates with an in-between software.",

The backend is built in Python and it analyzes user reviews (feedback from people on the company's app) using natural language processing (NLP) and generates the output (what users have the most trouble with, what they like best, what they all have in common, etc). It then visualizes the output in different ways: word clouds or Matplotlib. The website backend is built in Node.js and it picks up Python's output and shows it on the website in its own way.",
